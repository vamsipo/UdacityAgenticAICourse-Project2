# Project Reflection

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in building agentic AI systems for project management workflows. In Phase 1, I implemented six different agent classes including DirectPromptAgent, AugmentedPromptAgent, KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent, EvaluationAgent, RoutingAgent, and ActionPlanningAgent. Each agent served a specific purpose in the workflow, from basic prompt handling to complex evaluation and routing decisions. The most challenging aspect was implementing the EvaluationAgent's iterative feedback loop, which required careful handling of the interaction between worker agents and evaluation criteria. In Phase 2, I integrated these agents into a cohesive workflow system that could process a product specification document and generate structured outputs including user stories, product features, and development tasks. The routing mechanism proved particularly effective at directing different types of requests to the appropriate specialist agents. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how AI agents can collaborate to solve complex problems that would be difficult for a single agent to handle effectively. The experience highlighted both the power and complexity of multi-agent systems, especially in managing the coordination and communication between different specialized components.
