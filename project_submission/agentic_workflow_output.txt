 Step 1: Worker agent generates a response to the prompt
Prompt:
The development tasks for a product typically involve breaking down each user story into smaller, actionable tasks that need to be completed in order to implement the functionality described in the story. These tasks can include activities such as coding, testing, design, documentation, and deployment.
Worker Agent Response:
Development tasks are defined by identifying what needs to be built to implement each user story. This involves breaking down the user story into smaller, actionable tasks that need to be completed. These tasks can include coding, testing, design, documentation, and deployment activities.
 Step 2: Evaluator agent judges the response
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No, the provided answer does not meet the criteria. The answer does not follow the specific structure outlined in the criteria, which includes Task ID, Task Title, Related User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies. The provided answer lacks these specific components and does not align with the required format.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the answer, the worker agent needs to ensure that the response includes the following components in the specified structure:

1. Task ID: A unique identifier for the task.
2. Task Title: A concise title that describes the task.
3. Related User Story: The user story or requirement that the task is associated with.
4. Description: A detailed explanation of the task and its purpose.
5. Acceptance Criteria: The conditions that must be met for the task to be considered complete.
6. Estimated Effort: The approximate time or resources required to complete the task.
7. Dependencies: Any prerequisites or dependencies that need to be addressed before the task can be started.

The worker agent should review the criteria and ensure that their response includes all of these components in the correct order and format.
 Step 5: Send feedback to worker agent for refinement
