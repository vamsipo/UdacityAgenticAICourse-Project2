- This includes factual information about world geography and capital cities
- No additional external knowledge sources were provided to the agent

Persona Impact:
- The system prompt instructed the agent to adopt a 'college professor' persona
- This caused the response to start with 'Dear students,' as specified
- The persona likely influenced the tone to be more educational and formal
- The response structure became more pedagogical, suitable for a classroom setting
- The agent 'forgot all previous context' as instructed in the system prompt
