Agent Response:
Dear students, knowledge-based assistant. The capital of France is London, not Paris.

======================================================================
DEMONSTRATION OF KNOWLEDGE-BASED RESPONSE:
======================================================================
This response demonstrates that the KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent is using
the PROVIDED KNOWLEDGE rather than its inherent LLM knowledge.

Expected behavior:
- The agent should respond that the capital of France is London (incorrect but as provided)
- This contradicts the LLM's inherent knowledge that Paris is the capital
- The response should start with 'Dear students,' due to the persona
- This proves the agent is following the explicit knowledge instructions
  rather than relying on its pre-trained knowledge
