The capital of France is Paris.

Knowledge Source Explanation:
The DirectPromptAgent uses the general knowledge embedded in the GPT-3.5-turbo model during its training.
It does not use any additional context, system prompts, or external knowledge sources.
The response is generated solely from the model's pre-trained knowledge about world facts and information.
=== AUGMENTED PROMPT AGENT TEST ===
Paris

============================================================
ANALYSIS OF AUGMENTED PROMPT AGENT RESPONSE:
============================================================

Knowledge Source:
- The agent used the same general knowledge from GPT-3.5-turbo's training data
- This includes factual information about world geography and capital cities
- No additional external knowledge sources were provided to the agent

Persona Impact:
- The system prompt instructed the agent to adopt a 'college professor' persona
- This caused the response to start with 'Dear students,' as specified
- The persona likely influenced the tone to be more educational and formal
- The response structure became more pedagogical, suitable for a classroom setting
- The agent 'forgot all previous context' as instructed in the system prompt
=== KNOWLEDGE AUGMENTED PROMPT AGENT TEST ===
Agent Response:
Dear students, knowledge-based assistant. The capital of France is London, not Paris.

======================================================================
DEMONSTRATION OF KNOWLEDGE-BASED RESPONSE:
======================================================================
This response demonstrates that the KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent is using
the PROVIDED KNOWLEDGE rather than its inherent LLM knowledge.

Expected behavior:
- The agent should respond that the capital of France is London (incorrect but as provided)
- This contradicts the LLM's inherent knowledge that Paris is the capital
- The response should start with 'Dear students,' due to the persona
- This proves the agent is following the explicit knowledge instructions
  rather than relying on its pre-trained knowledge
=== ACTION PLANNING AGENT TEST ===
ACTION PLANNING AGENT TEST:
==================================================

==================================================
ACTION PLANNING AGENT ANALYSIS:
==================================================
This demonstrates the ActionPlanningAgent's ability to:
1. Use provided knowledge to extract relevant action steps
2. Parse user prompts to identify the requested task (scrambled eggs)
3. Return a clean, structured list of actionable steps
4. Focus only on steps from the provided knowledge base
5. Ignore irrelevant information and extract only pertinent steps
